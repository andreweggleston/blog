I've just had my first week at UMass Lowell, where I'm taking 4 courses: EECE2650 (Logic Design), ENGL2200 (Oral & Written Communication for CS majors), MATH3220 (Discrete Structures II), and what I'm most excited for, COMP3010 (Organization of Programming languages). I'm starting this blog to have a reason to reflect on what I've done at the end of every week, and to give myself some drive to stay engaged in my classes. 
I'm really looking forward to COMP3010. The professor, Anitha Gollamudi, worked on CertiKOS, a formally proved concurrent operating system kernel. CertiKOS was developed with the help of the Coq proof assistant, which I've had some exposure to after doing the first few chapters of the first book in Software Foundations. We'll be using Coq in COMP3010.
