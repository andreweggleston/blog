I've just had my first week at UMass Lowell, where I'm taking 4 courses: EECE-2650 (Logic Design), ENGL 2200 (Oral & Written Communication for CS majors), MATH-3220 (Discrete Structures II), and what I'm most excited for, COMP-3010 (Organization of Programming languages). I'm starting this blog to have a reason to reflect on what I've done at the end of every week, and to give myself some drive to stay engaged in my classes.
